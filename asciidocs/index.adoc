=== Date Functions
Difference between 2 Dates:

[source, sql]

select sysdate - pen_date from penalties;
----

Parse Date:

[source, sql]
----
select to_date('2022-01-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD') from dual;

Examples:

[source, sql]

select count(*) from dual; /* returns: 1*/

select * from dual;

/* Amount of players that are from Stratford */
select count(*) from players where TOWN = 'Stratford';

/* highest penalty */
select max(AMOUNT) from PENALTIES;
----

== Clauses
A SQL statement is made out of Clauses, and they could look like this;

[source, sql]
----
select .. from ..
[WHERE ..]
[CONNECT BY ..]
[GROUP BY ..]
    [HAVING ..]
[ORDER BY ..]
----

=== Table and Columnnames

[source,sql]
----
select PEN_DATE from PENALTIES;
----

is the same as:

[source, sql]
----
select MCTOM.PENALTIES.PEN_DATE from MCTOM.PENALTIES;
----

remove redundant lines:
[source, sql]
----
select distinct PLAYERNO from PLAYERS
----

== NULL
Null is special operator. +
If a Value is NULL it is unknown or undefined.

if you want to check if a Value is null, you can do this with "is null"

IMPORTANT: You can not check null with "= null"!

.Condition and given Datatype
|===
|Given Value | Condition | Evaluates to:

|10
|is null
|false

|10
|is not null
| true

|null
|is null
|true

|null
|is not null
|false

|10
|!= null
|UNKNOWN

|10
| = null
| UNKNOWN
|===

=== Examples:
[source, sql]
----
/*all players that are playing professionally*/
select * from PLAYERS where LEAGUENO is not null;
----

== IN Operator
with the In operator, you can check if a value is in a list of Values. +
Examples:

[source, sql]
----
/* Players with the numbers 6, 8, 27, 44 and 104 */
select * from PLAYERS where PLAYERNO in (6, 8, 27, 44, 104)

/* with the help of subqueries:
   All Players that have one or more Penalty: */
select * from PLAYERS
where PLAYERNO in (select distinct PLAYERNO from PENALTIES);
----

Example:

Output PlayerNo, name and initials of all Players, that have won at least 1 Match.

[source, sql]
----
select PLAYERNO, NAME, INITIALS from PLAYERS
where PLAYERNO in
(select PLAYERNO from MATCHES where WON >= 1);
----

== Order by
Order by sorts the output by a given value.

Example: All Towns and how many Players are in there sorted by Town

[source, sql]
----
select town, NAME as Players from PLAYERS order by TOWN;
----

== Group By
Groups the rows by a certain argument. For example groups the players by town:

[source, sql]
----
select TOWN, count(*) as Anzahl
from PLAYERS
group by TOWN;
----

Amount of penalties for each year:

[source, sql]
----
select to_char(PEN_DATE, 'yyyy') as YEAR, count(*) as AMOUNT, sum(AMOUNT) || ' €' as PENALTIES
from PENALTIES
group by to_char(PEN_DATE, 'yyyy')
order by 1;
----

== JOIN
A select statement is a join, when there are at least 2 Tables and a where statement that connects the Tables with each other.

[source, sql]
----
select * from PLAYERS, PENALTIES;
----
In this case we would get a cartesisches Product, that means that each row will be outputted with each row. +
This is why we have to check that the Players and the penalties have the same Playerno.

[source, sql]
----
select pl.PLAYERNO, pl.NAME, sum(pe.AMOUNT) as PENALTIES
from PLAYERS pl, PENALTIES pe
where pl.PLAYERNO = pe.PLAYERNO
group by pl.NAME, pl.PLAYERNO;
----

The most used Jointype is the Equijoin (Natural Join). +
// Der am häufigsten verwendete Jointyp ist der Equijoin (Vergleichsoperator = )

Join Types:
https://mctomspdo.github.io/school-SQL/docs/Join_NEU.pdf[Join_NEU.pdf]

=== Natural Join

[source, sql]
----
select emp.ENAME, dept.DNAME from EMP, DEPT
where EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO;
----

or

[source, sql]
----
select d.DEPTNO, e.ENAME, d.DNAME from EMP e, DEPT d
where e.DEPTNO = d.DEPTNO;
----

or

[source, sql]
----
select EMP.ENAME, DEPT.DNAME from EMP NATURAL join DEPT;

/* it can be also be written as: */
select EMP.ENAME, DEPT.DNAME from EMP INNER join DEPT on EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO;
----

inner Join combines the data from both Tables:

[source, sql]
----
select * from EMP e inner join DEPT d on e.DEPTNO = d.DEPTNO;
----

=== Mengen

image::mengen.png[]

==== left join:

[source, sql]
----
select *
from EMP e left join DEPT d
    on e.DEPTNO = d.DEPTNO;
----
The outcome should be 15 rows long

==== inner join:

[source, sql]
----
select *
from EMP e inner join DEPT d
    on e.DEPTNO = d.DEPTNO;
----
The outcome should be 14 lines long, since the BIGBOSS does not have a DeptNo.

==== left join + null

[source, sql]
----
select *
from EMP e left join DEPT d
    on e.DEPTNO = d.DEPTNO
where e.DEPTNO is null or d.DEPTNO is null;
----

==== full outer join

[source, sql]
----
select *
from EMP e full outer join DEPT d
    on e.DEPTNO = d.DEPTNO;
----

==== full outer join + null

[source, sql]
----
select *
from EMP e full outer join DEPT d
    on e.DEPTNO = d.DEPTNO
where d.DEPTNO is null or e.DEPTNO is null;
----

[source,sql]
----
/* FIXME: Nächstes Mal*/
select *
from EMP e, DEPT d
where e.DEPTNO  = d.DEPTNO (+) and (d.DEPTNO is null or e.DEPTNO is null);
----

==== right join
The opposite for the left join

[source,sql]
----
select *
from EMP e right join DEPT D
    on e.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO;
----

16 rows

==== right join + null

[source, sql]
----
Select *
from emp e right join dept d
    on e.deptno=d.deptno
where d.deptno is null;
----

0 rows
